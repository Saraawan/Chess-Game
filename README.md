# Chess Game in C++ using Data Structures and Algorithms
Introduction
Chess is a timeless game that challenges players to outwit and outmaneuver each other through strategic thinking. This project explores the implementation of a chess game using C++ and fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. By building our own chess engine, we delve into the intricacies of the game, from representing the board state to implementing rules and strategies. Key DSA principles are leveraged to design efficient algorithms for move generation, board evaluation, and game tree search, utilizing data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and trees.

Objective
Implement the basic structure and functionality of a chess game, including setting up the board, representing pieces, and implementing movement rules.
Develop data structures for board representation, utilizing arrays, linked lists, or other suitable structures.
Implement move generation and validation algorithms, considering piece-specific rules and game constraints.
Establish game logic for alternating player turns, validating moves, and enforcing chess rules such as checkmate and pawn promotion.
Thoroughly test and debug the chess engine to ensure correctness and adherence to chess rules.
Problem Description
Building a chess game in C++ using DSA involves efficiently representing the board and pieces, implementing move generation and validation, managing game logic and player turns, and optimizing performance. Additional challenges include implementing features like castling and passant capture, as well as testing and debugging the engine for correctness and reliability.
